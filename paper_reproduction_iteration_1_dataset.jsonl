Use AI-powered algorithms to predict the correct time when the traffic lights will change to red or yellow. This feature utilizes data from sensors, traffic counts, and weather conditions to anticipate the timing of the traffic lights and adjust the controller accordingly.\n\n2. Adjust the vehicle speed based on the road condition\n\na. Use AI-powered road condition data to detect traffic conditions and predict the appropriate speed. For instance, if there is heavy traffic, the controller might adjust the vehicle speed accordingly.\n\nb.

Once you reach the intersection, the AI assistant will follow the standard traffic rules for entering an intersection.

The following actions will occur:\n\n- Turn on your brakes\n- Lock your brakes\n- Check the position of the other cars on the road\n- Wait for the red light to change color\n\nStep 3: Stopping at the red light\n\nWhen the red light turns green, the AI assistant will slow down its speed and stop its vehicle.
